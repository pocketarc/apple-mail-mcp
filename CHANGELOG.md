# Changelog

All notable changes to the Apple Mail MCP Server will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.5.0] - 2025-01-17

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `move_email` now requires `message_id` parameter for precise email targeting
  - Removed `subject_keyword` parameter (use `search_emails` to find emails first)
  - Removed `max_moves` parameter (only one email is moved per call)
  - This prevents accidental moves of wrong emails when multiple match a subject keyword

### Migration Guide
If you were using `move_email(subject_keyword="...")`:
1. First call `search_emails(subject_keyword="...")` to find matching emails
2. Then call `move_email(message_id="<id>")` for each email you want to move
